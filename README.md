# SJSU MATH261A Regression Analysis Project One

MATH 261A Project 1 Repository

Author: Susan Peck

Date: October 29, 2025

## File Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

-   data - contains a csv file of public data from the 2024 SAFER Program (see Data below)

-   paper - contains a quarto document, a pdf of the final paper, images used in the paper, and references.bib

## Data

This paper uses data from the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/). The specific data is from the [2024 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report through the SAFER program](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/safer-failing-and-at-risk-drinking-water-systems/resource/05f23e58-820c-4f86-abc4-f873192c99d4) and definitions from the original 2021 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report. The reports were prepared by the California State Water Resources Control Board within the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), in partnership with the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation (UCLA).

## External Resources

The final report and code were written by Susan Peck.

The following resources were used for preliminary research:

-   State of California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) [[website](https://oehha.ca.gov/)]
-   ChatGPT
-   Google search AI answers
-   Stack Overflow
-   Speaking with Ali and Isis

Search Engines and ChatGPT were to verify that I was not missing crucial information like types of assumptions used in a t-test, and as a thesaurus when I used the word "suggests" one too many times. Stack Overflow was used to re-teach or learn details of options on R code, usually within ggplot. All work was done by myself, and no one else.
