# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

This paper looks at whether an environmental, health, and socioeconomic
score is related to the risk of small water systems failing in
California. Using 2024 data from the Drinking Water Needs Assessment and
the CalEnviroScreen tool, the study focuses on systems serving fewer
than 3,300 connections. A simple linear regression model tested how the
CalEnviroScreen score, which measures pollution burden and population
characteristic, relates to the Total Risk Score for each water system.
The results show a small but significant positive relationship. The
communities with higher pollution tend to have water systems at greater
risk. However, the model explains only a small part of the variation, so
it should not be used alone to predict risk. The findings suggest
pollution data can help guide support for disadvantaged communities but
need to be combined with other measures.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

California drinking water is safe for 98% [@2024needsreport] of the
population and meets California state drinking water standards that are
more strict than federal regulations. This still leaves about 400
failing water systems serving 870,000 people, 600 water systems serving
1.6 million people that are at risk of failure, and more than 400 others
serving another 1.6 million that are potentially at risk of failing
[@waterfail]. Smaller communities and populations that are economically
disadvantaged may be more at risk of having water with higher levels of
contaminants, or they may not have the resources to address and fix
problems with the water system.

In 2016 the California State Water Resource Board adopted a Human Right
to Water Resolution that includes a statement that "every human being
has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate
for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes." The goals of
Human Right to Water are to provide safe drinking water, accessible
drinking water, affordable drinking water, and/or maintaining a
sustainable and resilient water system. In 2019 California established
the Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER)
Program with the goal of helping struggling water systems and to help
provide affordable safe drinking water. In 2021 SAFER performed a Needs
Assessment and provided recommendations to try to determine where and
how funds should be used to have the most impact in improving failing or
at risk water systems.

The California State Water Board conducted the risk assessment with 19
indicators across four categories. The categories are Water Quality,
Accessibility, Affordability, and Technical, Managerial, and Financial
(TMF) Capacity. Each year the Needs Assessment is updated and the data
published with risk assessment scores for each subcategory. This paper
will focus on 2024 data and the total weighted risk assessment scores
from communities with fewer than 3300 service connections.

Funding has been provided to try and address inequities in small water
systems and fix problems in a sustainable way. This paper will
investigate to see if there are correlations between the water system
risk assessment score from the Needs Assessment and a pollution burden
score called CalEnviroScreen score calculated by the Office of Health
Hazard Assessment. Can we see a connection between populations that have
a general higher burden from pollution and water systems that are
failing or at risk of failing? Could we use the CalEnviroScreen score to
predict communities that should receive help and funding to their water
system?

This paper will provide details and definitions for the data obtained
from the Drinking Water Needs Assessment, the indicators that are used
to calculate the Total Risk for a water system, and the indicators that
are used to calculate the CalEnviroScreen Score in the Data @sec-data.
It will describe the general simple linear regression model and define
the variables used to analyze potential correlations in the Methods
@sec-methods. A simple linear regression model will be fitted to the
data and show a positive linear association between the CalEnviroScreen
Score and the Total Risk Score in the Results @sec-results, along with
analysis of the residuals. The Discussion @sec-discussion will talk
about the positive association seen in the linear regression model and
that though there seems to be some significance to values in the model,
it would probably not be good to use the model to predict which
communities could use funding based only on the CalEnviroScreen score
with out additional investigation because both are calculations based on
multiple indicator values. Some of the indicators overlap in information
like socioeconomic status.

# Data {#sec-data}

This paper uses data from the 2024 Drinking Water Needs Assessment
report [@2024needsreport] through the SAFER program and definitions from
the original 2021 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report
[@2021needsreport]. The data was gathered from water systems' annual
reports, water quality testing results sent to the California Water
Board, and Census data. This data set contains information from 3214
different water systems in California, each with 140 variables with
information about the water system. The Drinking Water Needs Assessment
reports were prepared by the California State Water Resources Control
Board within the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), in
partnership with the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation (UCLA).

The report calculated a risk assessment value for each water system. The
Risk Assessment Result is based off of a score for each of 19 risk
indicators (see @fig-risk). A standardized score is a value between 0
and 1. Weight values between 1 and 3 were applied to the individual risk
indicators. This resulted in a sub-score value for each subcategory. A
total weighted risk value, called Total Risk Score for this paper, was
calculated using the four subcategories scores. The result was used to
indicate if the water system was At-Risk, Not-At-Risk, or
Potentially-At-Risk. Some systems were not evaluated and have a Not
Assessed value.

![Risk Indicator Categories](Risk_Indicators_2021.png){#fig-risk
fig-align="center" width="475"}

All "At Risk" systems exceed a 'threshold of concern' (see
@sec-thresholds for specific values) for at least four risk indicators.

The Needs Assessment spent time trying to figure out a threshold for
what would make water unaffordable to the residents of that water
system. Affordability in this data set is based on three measured
values: the percent of the MHI, a comparison to the state average water
bill, and the number of shut-offs of water. ([@sec-thresholds])

Accessibility is a combination of five indicators that include how many
sources a water system has, if the system is reliant on connections to
other systems, and what types of sources (groundwater, snow, rivers,
etc.) This score also includes information about droughts and
overdrafted water basins.

TMF Capacity risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial
and financial (TMF) capacity to actually maintain a water system long
term.

This paper looks at how the Total Risk Score varies compared to the
California Environmental Screening Score for that community. The Total
Risk Score is calculated based on weighted sub-scores from Water
Quality, Affordability, Accessibility, and TMF Capacity, (See longer
definitions in @sec-definitions). The CalEnviroScreen Score is
calculated based of two sub-scores from Pollution Burden and Population
Characteristics.

The CalEnviroScreen [@calenviro] is a score created by the State of
California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that
uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce
scores for every census tract in the state. The 20 indicators
(@sec-calenviroindicator) fall into four sub-categories: Exposures,
Environmental Effects, Sensitive Populations, and Socioeconomic factors.
Each indicator is based on current data from a public agency and every
piece of data has a location where the measurement was taken. A higher
score is an area that has a higher pollution burden than a lower score.

The values used in this paper are based on calculated scores from
individual indicator values. Each part of the calculation and the data
collection are subject to uncertainty or subjective analysis. Some of
the data is from testing in labs, like presence of bacteria or toxins,
and other data is choices made by people of which indicators to keep or
exclude in the calculations.

# Methods {#sec-methods}

This paper looks at the results of a simple linear regression model
shown below.

$$Y_i = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$

$Y_i$ represents the response variable. In this paper the response
variable is the Total Risk Score.

$X_i$ represents the predictor variable. In this paper the predictor
variable is the CalEnviroScreen Score.

Both the response and predictor variable are scaled and weighted scores
based on percentages, so the variables do not have units.

$\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the model. For the linear regression
analysis this would be the expected mean value of the Total Risk Score
for a small water system with a CalEnviroScreen Score of 0. The
theoretical range for the CalEnviroScreen Score is 0 to 100, but in a
practical sense 0 is not a possible score.

$\beta_1$ is the slope of the model. The slope represents how much the
response variable changes for a unit change in the predictor variable.
In the regression model the slope would represent how much we would
expect the mean Total Risk Score to change based on a one unit change
for the CalEnviroScreen Score.

$\varepsilon_i$ are the error terms.

This model assumes a linear relationship between Y and X. If the actual
relationship between Y and X is not a linear one, then the model could
be a bad fit for the data, to the extreme of not being useful at all, or
possibly just have some bias and predictive values are off.

The model also assumes that the error terms are independent, have a
constant variance for all levels of the predictor variable X, the mean
of the error terms is zero, and the error terms are normally
distributed. If these assumptions are not true then the values and
confidence intervals can be misleading. For this data set the sample
size is large enough that the normality assumption is less important.

The analysis was done using R programming [@rcode] and built in
function, lm(), to fit the linear model and calculate estimated slope
and intercept values. The summary() function takes the fitted model and
provides a p-value for each of the estimates and a $R^2$ value.

In this analysis, the null hypothesis is that $\beta_1 = 0$ , meaning
that the slope of the linear regression model is zero, and the
alternative hypothesis is $\beta_1 \neq 0$. If the null hypothesis is
true, it would suggest that no linear relationship exists between the
response and predictor variables. A t test is used to evaluate this
hypothesis, and if the assumptions above are met, then a p-value less
than 0.05 would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis. This means that
there is evidence that supports the idea of a linear relationship
between the response and predictor variables.

$R^2$, called the coefficient of multiple determination, is the
proportion of the variance of the response variable that is explained by
the model. $R^2$ is a value between 0 and 1, and the larger the value of
$R^2$ the more of the variation of the response variables is explained
by the model. SSR is the regression sum of squares, and SSTO is the
total sum of squares.

$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSTO}$$

After a couple years of funding and some improvements to small water
systems in California, are there correlations between risk indicator
scores? This paper will look at how the Total Risk Score varies with
CalEnviroScreen Score, and if a linear model is a good choice for the
association. Only smaller water systems with fewer than 3300 service
connections are included. In @fig-calenviro-totalRisk a scatterplot is
created showing a possible positive association between Total Risk Score
and CalEnviroScreen Score. Included in the scatterplot is a linear
regression line.

  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +

```

```{r}
#| echo: false # not going to print out the code, but will do the output

lm_calenviro <- lm(TOTAL_WEIGHTED_RISK_SCORE_BEFORE_DIVIDING_BY_CATEGORY_COUNT ~ CALENVIRO_SCREEN_SCORE, water_data_small_systems)
lm_calenviro_summary <- summary(lm_calenviro)

max_risk <- max(water_data_small_systems $TOTAL_WEIGHTED_RISK_SCORE_BEFORE_DIVIDING_BY_CATEGORY_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The simple linear regression model for this relationship would have a
$b_0$ value of `r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[1],3)` and the $b_1$ value of
`r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[2],4)`. As discussed in the Methods
@sec-methods, the intercept $b_0$ does not have great interpretation
because a predictor value of CalEnviroScreen Score equal to zero is not
a reasonable value for an actual data point. The $b_1$ value represents
the estimated slope of the linear model and means that for every unit
increase in the CalEnviroScreen Score for a small water system, the
Total Risk Score has increased by about
`r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[2],4)`. The positive slope matches the
visual on the scatterplot that there is a positive association.

In the model the p-value is small (much smaller than 0.001) for both the
intercept and slope estimates, indicating there may be some significance
to the model (see section @methods for p-value and $R^2$). However, the
large range of values in the data for each predictor level, and the
smaller $R^2$ value of `r lm_calenviro_summary$r.squared` means that the
model may not be the best fit for the data because only about 12.7% of
the variance in the data is explained by the model.

The CalEnviroScreen score is the result of several factors that may
contribute to pollution in an area and is not explained purely by the
income level of the local population.

The residual plot @fig-residuals from the linear regression model, plots
the residuals against the fitted value. If this plot shows random points
above and below zero with no clear trend then this suggests that the
model could be a good fit for the data. If the residuals show a trend
that is curved or something that is not horizontal at y=0, it could
suggest some of the assumptions in the model are not met.

```{r fig-residuals}
#| echo: false # not going to print out the code, but will do the plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Residual plot of Total Risk Score versus CalEnvironScreen Score"

#plot(lm_calenviro, which = 1,  main = "Residual vs Fitted Values")
#title(sub = "Total Risk Score vs CalEnviroScreen Score Simple Linear Regression Model")

#plot(lm_calenviro, which = 1,  main = "Residual vs Fitted Values")
#plot(fitted(lm_calenviro), resid(lm_calenviro), main = "Residual vs Fitted Values", xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")
#abline(0,0)

ggplot(data.frame(residuals = residuals(lm_calenviro), fitted = fitted(lm_calenviro)),
       aes(x = fitted, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point() + # Scatter plot of residuals
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") + # Add horizontal line at zero
  xlab("Fitted Values") +
  ylab("Residuals") +
  labs(title = "Residual vs Fitted Values", sub = "Total Risk Score vs CalEnviroScreen Score Simple Linear Regression Model")

```

The residual plot @fig-residuals does not display an obvious visual
trend in the residuals. This suggesting that the residuals do not have
their own significant pattern that is not explained by the model. The
residuals appear to be spread wider above the y=0 line, possibly
suggesting that it is not a symmetrical distribution. The residuals also
have a wider range on the right of the plot, fanning out slightly,
meaning the assumption of constant variance in the error terms is not
met. The values from the t-test may not be reliable.

```{r fig-qq}
#| echo: false # not going to print out the code, but will do the plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Q-Q plot for Residuals of Total Risk Score versus CalEnvironScreen Score Linear Regression"

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(sample = resid(lm_calenviro))) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  labs(title = "Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
       y = "Sample Quantiles") +
  theme_minimal()
```

In the Q-Q plot of the residuals @fig-qq the values stray far from the
y=x line, suggesting that the assumption of normality in the errors is
not met. However, this analysis has over 2000 data points which limits
the reliance on the assumption of normality and does not mean the model
is useless or useful by itself.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

If the CalEnviroScreen Scores are a good predictor of the Total Risk
Score response variable, a possible application of the model would be to
use the CalEnviroScreen scores to decide which small water systems get
funding and resources. Right now there are multiple California agencies
looking at similar data and ideas: can we identify factors that affect
drinking water quality, what factors put small water systems at risk for
contamination, and what factors put small water systems at risk of
failing to provide safe and accessible water? Multiple agencies
repeating the same efforts puts a strain on resources. If information
that already exists can be used to predict which water systems are at
risk of failing for any reason, then the funding can have a more direct
and efficient path.

The linear model in this paper suggests that there is a positive
association between the two scores, and a linear model is an appropriate
model to use. However, both scores are based on a weighted calculation
of approximately 20 indicators each. Some of the indicators in both
calculations overlap in the information they provide. Both scores look
at socioeconomic status of the populations served in different locations
and use it as part of the calculation. The positive association between
the two scores is probably due in part to the overlap in the information
in the calculations of the score.

Does this mean that the CalEnviroScreen Score could be used instead of
the Total Risk Score in determining which small water systems should
receive funding? The positive association suggests that it is a
possibility, but because of the overlap in information used to calculate
the scores more work needs to be done to show that CalEnviroScreen Score
is actually a good tool to allocate funding. How much of each score is
based on the overlapping information? Does the overlap account entirely
for the positive association?

In addition, there is still work to be done to evaluate whether or not
the funding and improvements are actually helping the small water
systems that are at risk of failure. We still do not know if the Total
Risk Score is correctly identifying the communities with the highest
need or highest risk, and if the improvements are making sustainable
long term improvements.

# Appendix A DEFINITIONS {#sec-definitions}

*Affordability Threshold* means the level, point, or value that
delineates if a water system’s residential customer charges, designed to
ensure the water systems can provide drinking water that meets State and
Federal standards, are unaffordable. For the purposes of the 2021
Affordability Assessment, the State Water Board employed affordability
thresholds for the following indicators: Percent Median Household
Income; Extreme Water Bill; and Percent Shut-Offs. Learn more about
current and future indicators and affordability thresholds in Appendix
E.

*Affordability Assessment* means the identification of any community
water system that serves a disadvantaged community that must charge fees
that exceed the affordability threshold established by the State Water
Board in order to supply, treat, and distribute potable water that
complies with Federal and state drinking water standards. The
Affordability Assessment evaluates several different affordability
indicators to identify communities that may be experiencing
affordability challenges. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116769, subd. (2)(B).

*At-Risk public water systems* or *At-Risk PWS* means community water
systems with 3,300 service connections or less and K-12 schools that are
at risk of failing to meet one or more key Human Right to Water goals:
(1) providing safe drinking water; (2) accessible drinking water; (3)
affordable drinking water; and/or (4) maintaining a sustainable water
system.

*Median household income* or *MHI* means the household income that
represents the median or middle value for the community. The methods
utilized for calculating median household income are included in
Appendix A and Appendix E. Median household incomes in this document are
estimated values for the purposes of this statewide assessment. Median
household income for determination of funding eligibility is completed
on a system by system basis by the State Water Board’s Division of
Financial Assistance.

*Risk indicator* means the quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the potential for a community
water system or a transient noncommunity water system that serves a K-12
school to fail to sustainably provide an adequate supply of safe
drinking water due to water quality, water accessibility, affordability,
institutional, and/or TMF capacity issues.

*Risk threshold* means the levels, points, or values associated with an
individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is more
at-risk of failing, typically based on regulatory requirements or
industry standards.

*Score* means a standardized numerical value that is scaled between 0
and 1 for risk points across risk indicators. Standardized scores enable
the evaluation and comparison of risk indicators.

*Service connection* means the point of connection between the
customer’s piping or constructed conveyance, and the water system’s
meter, service pipe, or constructed conveyance, with certain exceptions
set out in the definition in the Health and Safety Code. (See Health &
Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (s).)

*Small community water system* means a CWS that serves no more than
3,300 service connections or a yearlong population of no more than
10,000 persons. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (z).)

*Risk Indicators* means quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the probability of a water
system’s failure to deliver safe drinking water or other infrastructure
and institutional failures. Risk indicators that measure water quality,
accessibility, affordability, and TMF capacity are incorporated based on
their criticality as it relates to a system’s ability to remain in
compliance with safe drinking water standards and their data
availability and quality across the State.

*Risk Indicator Thresholds* are the levels, points, or values associated
with an individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is
more at-risk of failing.

*Scores & Weights* are the application of a multiplying value or weight
to each risk indicator and risk category, as certain risk indicators and
categories may be deemed more critical than others and/or some may be
out of the control of the water system. The application of weights to
risk indicators and risk categories allows the State Water Board
multiple ways to assess all risk indicators within each category
together in a combined Risk Assessment score.

*TMF Capacity* risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial
and financial (TMF) capacity to plan for, achieve, and maintain long
term compliance with drinking water standards, thereby ensuring the
quality and adequacy of the water supply.
