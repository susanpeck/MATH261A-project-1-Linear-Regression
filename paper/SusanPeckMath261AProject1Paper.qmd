# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

This will be a great abstract summarizing everything succinctly and also making sure that people want to read the rest of my paper. It will be intriguing and informative.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

California drinking water is safe for 98% [@2024needsreport] of the
population and meets state drinking water standards that are more strict
than federal regulations. Smaller communities and populations that are
economically disadvantaged may be more at risk of having water with
higher levels of contaminants, or they may not have the resources to
address and fix a problem with the water system.

In 2016 the California State Water Resource Board adopted a Human Right
to Water Resolution that includes a statement that "every human being
has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate
for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes." The goals of
Human Right to Water are to provide safe drinking water, accessible
drinking water, affordable drinking water, and/or maintaining a
sustainable and resilient water system. In 2019 California established
the Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER)
Program with the goal of helping struggling water systems and to help
provide affordable safe drinking water. In 2021 SAFER performed a Needs
Assessment to try to determine where and how funds should be used to
have the most impact in improving failing or at risk water systems and
provided recommendations.

The California State Water Board conducted the risk assessment with 19
indicators across four categories. The categories were Water Quality,
Accessibility, Affordability, and Technical, Managerial, and Financial
(TMF) Capacity. Each year the Needs Assessment was updated and the data
published with risk assessment scores for each category. This paper will
focus on 2024 data and the scores from each of the categories from
communities with fewer than 3300 service connections.

WHAT IS MY MAIN QUESTION?

DESCRIBE THE PAPER OUTLINE

# Data {#sec-data}

This paper uses data from the 2024 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report
[@2024needsreport] through the SAFER program and definitions from the original
2021 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report [@2021needsreport]. The
reports were prepared by the California State Water Resources Control
Board within the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), in
partnership with the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation (UCLA).

The report calculated a risk assessment value for each water system. The Risk Assessment Result is based off of a score for each of 19 risk
indicators (see figure below). A standardized score is a value between 0
and 1. Weight values between 1 and 3 were applied to the individual risk
indicators. This resulted in a score value for each subcategory. A total
weighted risk value was calculated using the four subcategories scores.
The result was used to indicate if the water system was At-Risk,
Not-At-Risk, or Potentially-At-Risk. Some systems were not evaluated and
have a Not Assessed value.

All "At Risk" systems exceed a 'threshold of concern' (see
@sec-thresholds for specific values) for at least four risk indicators.

This paper looks at the individual subcategory scores, a California Environmental Screening Score, population, and Mean Household Income (MHI), and investigates the possible relationships between those variables. The subcategories are Water Quality, Affordability, Accessibility, and TMF Capacity. (See longer definitions from the Needs Assessment report @sec-definitions) 

The CalEnviroScreen [@calenviro] is a score created by the State of California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in the state. A higher score is an area that has a higher pollution burden than a lower score. Below is a scatterplot of the CalEnvironScreen score compared to MHI for that water system. Only smaller water systems with fewer than 3300 service connections are included. Each data point is colored to show if the water system is at risk of failing to provide clean drinking water.

  xlab("Median Household Income ($)") +
  labs(title = "California Environmental Screening Score vs Median Household Income", subtitle = "Grouped by Small Water Systems' Risk Assessment Value")

```

The Needs Assessment spent time trying to figure out a threshold for what would make water unaffordable.

ACCESSIBILITY_SCORE

TMF_CAPACITY_SCORE

TMF Capacity risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial and
financial (TMF) capacity to plan for, achieve, and maintain long term compliance with drinking
water standards, thereby ensuring the quality and adequacy of the water supply.



# Methods {#sec-methods}

This paper looks at the results of a simple linear regression model shown below.

$$Y_i = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$

$Y_i$ represents the response variable. In this analysis the response variable is

$X_i$ represents the predictor variable. In this analysis the predictor variable is

$\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the model. 

$\beta_1$ is the slope of the model. The slope represents how much the response variable changes for a unit change in the predictor variable. In this model 



The analysis was done using R programming {@rcode} and built in function, lm, to fit the linear model. 




# Results {#sec-results}


# Appendix A DEFINITIONS {#sec-definitions}

“Affordability Threshold” means the level, point, or value that
delineates if a water system’s residential customer charges, designed to
ensure the water systems can provide drinking water that meets State and
Federal standards, are unaffordable. For the purposes of the 2021
Affordability Assessment, the State Water Board employed affordability
thresholds for the following indicators: Percent Median Household
Income; Extreme Water Bill; and Percent Shut-Offs. Learn more about
current and future indicators and affordability thresholds in Appendix
E.

“Affordability Assessment” means the identification of any community
water system that serves a disadvantaged community that must charge fees
that exceed the affordability threshold established by the State Water
Board in order to supply, treat, and distribute potable water that
complies with Federal and state drinking water standards. The
Affordability Assessment evaluates several different affordability
indicators to identify communities that may be experiencing
affordability challenges. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116769, subd. (2)(B).

“At-Risk public water systems” or “At-Risk PWS” means community water
systems with 3,300 service connections or less and K-12 schools that are
at risk of failing to meet one or more key Human Right to Water goals:
(1) providing safe drinking water; (2) accessible drinking water; (3)
affordable drinking water; and/or (4) maintaining a sustainable water
system.

“Median household income” or “MHI” means the household income that
represents the median or middle value for the community. The methods
utilized for calculating median household income are included in
Appendix A and Appendix E. Median household incomes in this document are
estimated values for the purposes of this statewide assessment. Median
household income for determination of funding eligibility is completed
on a system by system basis by the State Water Board’s Division of
Financial Assistance.

“Risk indicator” means the quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the potential for a community
water system or a transient noncommunity water system that serves a K-12
school to fail to sustainably provide an adequate supply of safe
drinking water due to water quality, water accessibility, affordability,
institutional, and/or TMF capacity issues.

“Risk threshold” means the levels, points, or values associated with an
individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is more
at-risk of failing, typically based on regulatory requirements or
industry standards.

“Score” means a standardized numerical value that is scaled between 0
and 1 for risk points across risk indicators. Standardized scores enable
the evaluation and comparison of risk indicators.

“Service connection” means the point of connection between the
customer’s piping or constructed conveyance, and the water system’s
meter, service pipe, or constructed conveyance, with certain exceptions
set out in the definition in the Health and Safety Code. (See Health &
Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (s).)

“Small community water system” means a CWS that serves no more than
3,300 service connections or a yearlong population of no more than
10,000 persons. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (z).)

"Risk Indicators" means quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the probability of a water
system’s failure to deliver safe drinking water or other infrastructure
and institutional failures. Risk indicators that measure water quality,
accessibility, affordability, and TMF capacity are incorporated based on
their criticality as it relates to a system’s ability to remain in
compliance with safe drinking water standards and their data
availability and quality across the State.

"Risk Indicator Thresholds" are the levels, points, or values associated
with an individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is
more at-risk of failing.

"Scores & Weights" are the application of a multiplying value or weight
to each risk indicator and risk category, as certain risk indicators and
categories may be deemed more critical than others and/or some may be
out of the control of the water system. The application of weights to
risk indicators and risk categories allows the State Water Board
multiple ways to assess all risk indicators within each category
together in a combined Risk Assessment score.

"TMF Capacity" risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial and
financial (TMF) capacity to plan for, achieve, and maintain long term compliance with drinking
water standards, thereby ensuring the quality and adequacy of the water supply.
