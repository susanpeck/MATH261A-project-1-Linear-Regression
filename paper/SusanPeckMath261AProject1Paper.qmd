# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

This will be a great abstract summarizing everything succinctly and also
making sure that people want to read the rest of my paper. It will be
intriguing and informative. I understand that not having an abstract in
my draft means that you can not give me constructive and timely feedback
on this part of my paper.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

California drinking water is safe for 98% [@2024needsreport] of the
population and meets California state drinking water standards that are
more strict than federal regulations. This still leaves about 400
failing water systems serving 870,000 people, 600 water systems serving
1.6 million people that are at risk of failure, and more than 400 others
serving another 1.6 million that are potentially at risk of failing.
[@waterfail] Smaller communities and populations that are economically
disadvantaged may be more at risk of having water with higher levels of
contaminants, or they may not have the resources to address and fix
problems with the water system.

In 2016 the California State Water Resource Board adopted a Human Right
to Water Resolution that includes a statement that "every human being
has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate
for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes." The goals of
Human Right to Water are to provide safe drinking water, accessible
drinking water, affordable drinking water, and/or maintaining a
sustainable and resilient water system. In 2019 California established
the Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience (SAFER)
Program with the goal of helping struggling water systems and to help
provide affordable safe drinking water. In 2021 SAFER performed a Needs
Assessment and provided recommendations to try to determine where and
how funds should be used to have the most impact in improving failing or
at risk water systems.

The California State Water Board conducted the risk assessment with 19
indicators across four categories. The categories are Water Quality,
Accessibility, Affordability, and Technical, Managerial, and Financial
(TMF) Capacity. Each year the Needs Assessment is updated and the data
published with risk assessment scores for each subcategory. This paper
will focus on 2024 data and the total weighted risk assessment scores
from communities with fewer than 3300 service connections.

Funding has been provided to try and address inequities in small water
systems and fix problems in a sustainable way. This paper will
investigate to see if there are correlations between the water system
risk assessment score from the Needs Assessment and a pollution burden
score called CalEnviroScreen score calculated by the Office of Health
Hazard Assessment. Can we see a connection between populations that have
a general higher burden from pollution and water systems that are
failing or at risk of failing? Could we use the CalEnviroScreen score to
predict communities that should receive help and funding to their water
system?

This paper will provide details and definitions for the data obtained
from the Drinking Water Needs Assessment, the indicators that are used
to calculate the Total Risk for a water system, and the indicators that
are used to calculate the CalEnviroScreen Score in the Data @sec-data.
It will describe the general simple linear regression model and define
the variables used to analyze potential correlations in the Methods
@sec-methods. A simple linear regression model will be fitted to the
data and show a positive linear association between the CalEnviroScreen
Score and the Total Risk Score in the Results @sec-results, along with
analysis of the residuals. The Discussion @sec-discussion will talk
about the positive association seen in the linear regression model and
that though there seems to be some significance to values in the model,
it would probably not be good to use the model to predict which
communities could use funding based only on the CalEnviroScreen score.

ADD SOME ACTUAL NUMBERS TO THE INTRO?

# Data {#sec-data}

This paper uses data from the 2024 Drinking Water Needs Assessment
report [@2024needsreport] through the SAFER program and definitions from
the original 2021 Drinking Water Needs Assessment report
[@2021needsreport]. The data was gathered from water systems' annual
reports, water quality testing results sent to the California Water
Board, and Census data. The reports were prepared by the California
State Water Resources Control Board within the California Environmental
Protection Agency (CalEPA), in partnership with the UCLA Luskin Center
for Innovation (UCLA).

The report calculated a risk assessment value for each water system. The
Risk Assessment Result is based off of a score for each of 19 risk
indicators (see @fig-risk). A standardized score is a value between 0
and 1. Weight values between 1 and 3 were applied to the individual risk
indicators. This resulted in a sub-score value for each subcategory. A
total weighted risk value, called Total Risk Score for this paper, was
calculated using the four subcategories scores. The result was used to
indicate if the water system was At-Risk, Not-At-Risk, or
Potentially-At-Risk. Some systems were not evaluated and have a Not
Assessed value.

![Risk Indicator Categories](Risk_Indicators_2021.png){#fig-risk
fig-align="center" width="500"}

All "At Risk" systems exceed a 'threshold of concern' (see
@sec-thresholds for specific values) for at least four risk indicators.

The Needs Assessment spent time trying to figure out a threshold for
what would make water unaffordable to the residents of that water
system. Affordability in this data set is based on three measured
values: the percent of the MHI, a comparison to the state average water
bill, and the number of shut-offs of water. ([@sec-thresholds])

Accessibility is a combination of five indicators that include how many
sources a water system has, if the system is reliant on connections to
other systems, and what types of sources (groundwater, snow, rivers,
etc.) This score also includes information about droughts and
overdrafted water basins.

TMF Capacity risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial
and financial (TMF) capacity to actually maintain a water system long
term.

This paper looks at how the Total Risk Score varies compared to the
California Environmental Screening Score for that community. The Total
Risk Score is calculated based on weighted sub-scores from Water
Quality, Affordability, Accessibility, and TMF Capacity, (See longer
definitions in @sec-definitions). The CalEnviroScreen Score is
calculated based of two sub-scores from Pollution Burden and Population
Characteristics.

The CalEnviroScreen [@calenviro] is a score created by the State of
California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) that
uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce
scores for every census tract in the state. The 20 indicators
(@sec-calenviroindicator) fall into four sub-categories: Exposures,
Environmental Effects, Sensitive Populations, and Socioeconomic factors.
Each indicator is based on current data from a public agency and every
piece of data has a location where the measurement was taken. A higher
score is an area that has a higher pollution burden than a lower score.

# Methods {#sec-methods}

This paper looks at the results of a simple linear regression model
shown below.

$$Y_i = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$$

$Y_i$ represents the response variable. In this paper the response
variable is the Total Risk Score.

$X_i$ represents the predictor variable. In this paper the predictor
variable is the CalEnviroScreen Score.

Both the response and predictor variable are scaled and weighted scores
based on percentages, so the variables do not have units.

$\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the model. For the linear regression
analysis this would be the expected mean value of the Total Risk Score
for a small water system with a CalEnviroScreen Score of 0. The
theoretical range for the CalEnviroScreen Score is 0 to 100, but in a
practical sense 0 is not a possible score.

$\beta_1$ is the slope of the model. The slope represents how much the
response variable changes for a unit change in the predictor variable.
In the regression model the slope would represent how much we would
expect the mean Total Risk Score to change based on a one unit change
for the CalEnviroScreen Score.

$\varepsilon_i$ are the error terms.

This model assumes a linear relationship between Y and X. If the actual
relationship between Y and X is not a linear one, then the model could
be a bad fit for the data, to the extreme of not being useful at all, or
possibly just have some bias and predictive values are off.

The model also assumes that the error terms are independent, have a
constant variance for all levels of the predictor variable X, the mean
of the error terms is zero, and the error terms are normally
distributed. If these assumptions are not true then the values and
confidence intervals can be misleading. For this data set the sample
size is large enough that the normality assumption is less important.

The analysis was done using R programming {@rcode} and built in
function, lm, to fit the linear model and provide calculated estimate
values for the slope and intercept of the model. The summary function of
the lm model also shows a p-value for each of the estimates and a $R^2$
value.

# Results {#sec-results}

After a couple years of funding and some improvements to small water
systems in California, are there correlations between risk indicator
scores? To begin this analysis this paper looked at a scatterplot of the
CalEnviroScreen Score and MHI (@fig-calenviron-mhi). Only smaller water
systems with fewer than 3300 service connections are included. Each data
point is colored to show if the water system is at risk of failing to
provide clean drinking water by separating the data into four risk
categories.The larger the CalEnviroScreen Score, the more pollution a
population may be subject to. General pollution may or may not directly
impact water quality. The scatterplot below indicates lower MHI seems to
have more At-Risk water systems. The larger the value of the MHI for the
water system, the fewer water systems that have high CalEnviroScreen
score. This scatterplot is included to show the general range of
CalEnviroScreen scores for the small water systems in this paper and
possible grouping of risk levels.

  summarise(ave = mean(CALENVIRO_SCREEN_SCORE, na.rm = TRUE))
```

A second scatterplot (@fig-calenviro-mhi-DAC) again graphs
CalEnviroScreen Score against MHI, but this time groups the data by the
economic status of the service area. The status could be a Disadvantaged
Community (DAC), a Severely Disadvantaged Community (SDAC), or a
Non-Disadvantaged Community (Non-DAC). The classifications of how
disadvantaged a community is is a direct calculation based on MHI, as
shown by the vertical sections on the scatterplot. Both the DAC and SDAC
communities have a large range of CalEnviroScreen Scores. The Non-DAC
communities have a smaller range of values and the values are less in
general.

The SDAC communities CalEnviroScreen Score ranged from
`r round(min_dac_calenviro[3,2], 3)` to
`r round(max_dac_calenviro[3,2],3)` with and average value of
`r round(ave_dac_calenviro[3,2],3)`. The DAC communities CalEnviroScreen
Score ranged from `r round(min_dac_calenviro[1,2], 3)` to
`r round(max_dac_calenviro[1,2],3)` with and average value of
`r round(ave_dac_calenviro[1,2],3)`.The Non-DAC communities
CalEnviroScreen Score ranged from `r round(min_dac_calenviro[2,2], 3)`
to `r round(max_dac_calenviro[2,2],3)` with and average value of
`r round(ave_dac_calenviro[2,2],3)`.

Now this paper will look at how the Total Risk Score varies with
CalEnviroScreen Score, and if a linear model is a good choice for the
association. In @fig-calenviro-totalRisk a scatterplot is created
showing a possible positive association between Total Risk Score and
CalEnviroScreen Score. Included in the scatterplot is a linear
regression line.

  geom_smooth() +

```

```{r}

lm_calenviro <- lm(TOTAL_WEIGHTED_RISK_SCORE_BEFORE_DIVIDING_BY_CATEGORY_COUNT ~ CALENVIRO_SCREEN_SCORE, water_data_small_systems)
lm_calenviro_summary <- summary(lm_calenviro)

max_risk <- max(water_data_small_systems $TOTAL_WEIGHTED_RISK_SCORE_BEFORE_DIVIDING_BY_CATEGORY_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The simple linear regression model for this relationship would have a
$b_0$ value of `r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[1],3)` and the $b_1$ value of
`r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[2],4)`. As discussed in the Methods
@sec-methods, the intercept $b_0$ does not have great interpretation
because a predictor value of CalEnviroScreen Score equal to zero is not
a reasonable value for an actual data point. The $b_1$ value represents
the slope of the linear model and means that for every unit increase in
the CalEnviroScreen Score for a small water system, the Total Risk Score
has increased by about `r round(coef(lm_calenviro)[2],4)`. The positive
slope matches the visual on the scatterplot that there is a positive
association.

In the model the p-value is small (much smaller than 0.001) for both the
intercept and slope estimates, indicating there may be some significance
to the model. However, the large range of values in the data for each
predictor level, and the smaller $R^2$ value of
`r lm_calenviro_summary$r.squared` means that the model may not be the
best fit for the data and may not do a good job of explaining the
variance.

The CalEnviroScreen score is the result of several factors that may
contribute to pollution in an area and is not explained purely by the
income level of the local population.

Below is a residual plot from the linear regression model, plotting the
residual against the fitted value. If this plot shows random points
above and below zero with no clear trend then this suggests that the
model could be a good fit for the data. If the residuals show a trend
that is curved or something that is not horizontal at y=0, it could
suggest some of the assumptions in the model are not met.

```{r fig-residuals}
#| echo: false # not going to print out the code, but will do the plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Residual plot of Total Risk Score versus CalEnvironScreen Score"

#plot(lm_calenviro, which = 1,  main = "Residual vs Fitted Values")
#title(sub = "Total Risk Score vs CalEnviroScreen Score Simple Linear Regression Model")

#plot(lm_calenviro, which = 1,  main = "Residual vs Fitted Values")
#plot(fitted(lm_calenviro), resid(lm_calenviro), main = "Residual vs Fitted Values", xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")
#abline(0,0)

ggplot(data.frame(residuals = residuals(lm_calenviro), fitted = fitted(lm_calenviro)),
       aes(x = fitted, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point() + # Scatter plot of residuals
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "blue") + # Add a loess smoothed line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") + # Add horizontal line at zero
  xlab("Fitted Values") +
  ylab("Residuals") +
  labs(title = "Residual vs Fitted Values", sub = "Total Risk Score vs CalEnviroScreen Score Simple Linear Regression Model")

```

The residual plot @fig-residuals has a small trend line, dipping down in the middle and is not perfectly horizontal at y=0, but there is not a large trend in the residuals suggesting a significant pattern that is not explained by the model. The residuals appear to be spread wider above the y=0 line, possibly suggesting that it is not a symmetrical distribution. The residuals also have a wider range on the right of the plot, fanning
out slightly, meaning the assumption of constant variance in the error terms is
not met. The p-test or t-test values may not be reliable.


```{r fig-qq}
#| echo: false # not going to print out the code, but will do the plot
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Q-Q plot for Residuals of Total Risk Score versus CalEnvironScreen Score Linear Regression"

  labs(title = "Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
       y = "Sample Quantiles") +
  theme_minimal()
```
In the Q-Q plot of the residuals @fig-qq the values stray far from the y=x line, suggesting that the assumption of normality in the errors is not met. However, this analysis has over 2000 data points which limits the reliance on the assumption of normality and does not mean the model is useless or useful by itself. 


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

yes linear association validity? representativeness? errors independent,
constant variance, is this because both scores include indicators that
deal with socio-economic status? probably not a good model for
prediction yes it is nice because if we could use one, it saves
resources from having to do two completely separate risk calculations is
there a better way to get funding to the appropriate places instead of
waiting until water systems are already failing or at risk of failing?

i am pushing this very incomplete assignment so that I have something in both places, putting my kids to sleep, and hopefully back at it.

# Appendix A DEFINITIONS {#sec-definitions}

*Affordability Threshold* means the level, point, or value that
delineates if a water system’s residential customer charges, designed to
ensure the water systems can provide drinking water that meets State and
Federal standards, are unaffordable. For the purposes of the 2021
Affordability Assessment, the State Water Board employed affordability
thresholds for the following indicators: Percent Median Household
Income; Extreme Water Bill; and Percent Shut-Offs. Learn more about
current and future indicators and affordability thresholds in Appendix
E.

*Affordability Assessment* means the identification of any community
water system that serves a disadvantaged community that must charge fees
that exceed the affordability threshold established by the State Water
Board in order to supply, treat, and distribute potable water that
complies with Federal and state drinking water standards. The
Affordability Assessment evaluates several different affordability
indicators to identify communities that may be experiencing
affordability challenges. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116769, subd. (2)(B).

*At-Risk public water systems* or *At-Risk PWS* means community water
systems with 3,300 service connections or less and K-12 schools that are
at risk of failing to meet one or more key Human Right to Water goals:
(1) providing safe drinking water; (2) accessible drinking water; (3)
affordable drinking water; and/or (4) maintaining a sustainable water
system.

*Median household income* or *MHI* means the household income that
represents the median or middle value for the community. The methods
utilized for calculating median household income are included in
Appendix A and Appendix E. Median household incomes in this document are
estimated values for the purposes of this statewide assessment. Median
household income for determination of funding eligibility is completed
on a system by system basis by the State Water Board’s Division of
Financial Assistance.

*Risk indicator* means the quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the potential for a community
water system or a transient noncommunity water system that serves a K-12
school to fail to sustainably provide an adequate supply of safe
drinking water due to water quality, water accessibility, affordability,
institutional, and/or TMF capacity issues.

*Risk threshold* means the levels, points, or values associated with an
individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is more
at-risk of failing, typically based on regulatory requirements or
industry standards.

*Score* means a standardized numerical value that is scaled between 0
and 1 for risk points across risk indicators. Standardized scores enable
the evaluation and comparison of risk indicators.

*Service connection* means the point of connection between the
customer’s piping or constructed conveyance, and the water system’s
meter, service pipe, or constructed conveyance, with certain exceptions
set out in the definition in the Health and Safety Code. (See Health &
Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (s).)

*Small community water system* means a CWS that serves no more than
3,300 service connections or a yearlong population of no more than
10,000 persons. (Health & Saf. Code, § 116275, subd. (z).)

*Risk Indicators* means quantifiable measurements of key data points
that allow the State Water Board to assess the probability of a water
system’s failure to deliver safe drinking water or other infrastructure
and institutional failures. Risk indicators that measure water quality,
accessibility, affordability, and TMF capacity are incorporated based on
their criticality as it relates to a system’s ability to remain in
compliance with safe drinking water standards and their data
availability and quality across the State.

*Risk Indicator Thresholds* are the levels, points, or values associated
with an individual risk indicator that delineates when a water system is
more at-risk of failing.

*Scores & Weights* are the application of a multiplying value or weight
to each risk indicator and risk category, as certain risk indicators and
categories may be deemed more critical than others and/or some may be
out of the control of the water system. The application of weights to
risk indicators and risk categories allows the State Water Board
multiple ways to assess all risk indicators within each category
together in a combined Risk Assessment score.

*TMF Capacity* risk indicators measure a system’s technical, managerial
and financial (TMF) capacity to plan for, achieve, and maintain long
term compliance with drinking water standards, thereby ensuring the
quality and adequacy of the water supply.
